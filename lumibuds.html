              <p class="project-short">
                Lumi Buds is a dreamy wireless earbuds concept that blends gem-like forms, metallic finishes,
                and soft pastel lighting into a playful audio experience for kids and teens.
              </p>

              <p class="project-detail">
                The project explores how product design, 3D modeling, motion graphics, and interactive web
                experiences can work together to make tech feel magical, collectible, and fun to explore.
              </p>

                <p class="project-role-note">
                  From concept to execution, I handled every part of the Lumi Buds project independently —
                  including product sketches, 3D modeling, visual identity, motion graphics, and responsive
                  front-end layouts.

            <h3 class="project-heading">Project Overview</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
              Lumi Buds was created as a speculative product line that feels like a piece of jewelry and a
              piece of tech at the same time. The concept focuses on a shell-shaped charging case and gem-cut
              earbuds, designed for a “Prism Dreamz” collection that celebrates soft pastel colours, sparkles,
              and Y2K-inspired details.
            </p>
            <p class="project-text">
              The digital experience extends beyond static visuals — the 3D model is integrated into the web
              experience as an interactive AR object, complete with animated hotspots and responsive layouts
              that work across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

            <h3 class="project-heading">Concept Sketches & Form Exploration</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
              The design process started with quick pencil sketches to explore different silhouettes for the
              earbuds and charging case. I focused on a rounded, shell-inspired case and bulb-like earbuds
              that could hold floral earring studs, making the product feel like a wearable accessory rather
              than just a gadget.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-heading">Colour & Material Story</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
              Lumi Buds lives in a metallic, dream-like palette. The collection is built around three finishes:
              a soft rose pink, a matte champagne gold, and a cool matte silver. Together, they feel premium
              but still playful — almost like collectible accessories from a fantasy jewelry box.
            </p>
            <p class="project-text">
              These colours are paired with subtle glitter textures, soft gradients, and pastel backgrounds to
              keep the overall look light, airy, and magical.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-heading">Logo & Brand Mark</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
              The Lumi Buds logo uses an angular “LB” monogram that contrasts with the soft, rounded shapes of
              the earbuds. The mark feels faceted, like a gem, and works well on packaging, the charging case,
              and web layouts.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
              The hero poster introduces the Prism Dreamz collection with a floating charging case, glowing
              particles, and metallic earbuds framed by moons and stars. The composition is designed to feel
              like a fantasy product reveal — soft light, sparkles, and a dreamy tagline that ties sound and
              style together.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
              The 3D model of the earbuds was created in Cinema 4D and exported for the web, then integrated
              into the site using &lt;model-viewer&gt;. Users can rotate, zoom, and view the metallic finishes up
              close, while hotspots reveal key features like comfort fit, gem-inspired housing, and floral studs.
            </p>
            <p class="project-text">
              On mobile, the same content is re-framed into stacked sections, keeping the experience accessible
              even for smaller screens while maintaining the playful, motion-driven feeling of the desktop
              layout.

            <p class="project-text">
              To better explain how the product is built, I also created inside-look renders and an exploded
              view of the earbuds and case. These visuals break apart the shell, inner components, and floral
              studs, showing how the design balances structure, comfort, and decorative details.

            <h3 class="project-heading">Personal Reflection</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
              Lumi Buds was a chance for me to bring together everything I love — shiny objects, character-like
              products, motion, and interactive web. Building the 3D model, animating the hero visuals, and
              then turning it all into an AR-driven website pushed me to think about consistency across every
              touchpoint: from the first sketch, to the metallic colour story, to how someone taps through the
              hotspots on their phone.
            </p>
            <p class="project-text">
              It’s a project that reminds me how much I enjoy designing products that feel playful and
              collectible, while still being grounded in thoughtful front-end development and user experience.
