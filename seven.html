          <h1 class="project-title">SEVEN – Pet Care Brand</h1>

          <h2 class="project-label">ABOUT:</h2>
          <p class="project-text">
            SEVEN is a gentle, nature-inspired pet-care brand built around the idea of “seven days of pet love.”
            The brand focuses on calm, natural ingredients, soft colors, and a nurturing visual direction.
            This project includes branding, packaging, mockups, social media assets, a 2-page magazine spread,
            and a promotional video.
          </p>

          <h2 class="project-label">CASE STUDY:</h2>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Brand Concept &amp; Story</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            SEVEN communicates warmth, trust, and natural everyday care. The brand storyline emphasizes gentle routines,
            emotional connection, and the feeling of caring for pets every single day of the week. The overall direction
            balances a calm, eco-friendly look with a soft, friendly personality so the brand feels both safe and
            approachable for pet owners.
          </p>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Logo Development</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            The SEVEN logo merges three core elements: a heart, a paw, and a double 7. The heart symbolizes the bond
            between pets and their owners, the paw represents care and protection, and the double 7 expresses the idea of
            “seven days a week” routine care. Together, these shapes create a personal and memorable symbol that feels
            warm, loyal, and reassuring.
          </p>

          </div>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Brand Identity System</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            The SEVEN identity is built on a soft and natural color palette: light cream for calm space, sage and moss for
            freshness and growth, tangerine for warmth, and juniper for grounding stability. These colors work together
            to communicate gentle care and a nature-driven approach. Poppins is used for both headings and body copy,
            keeping the typography friendly, rounded, and modern.
          </p>

          </div>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Packaging Design</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            I designed packaging for three core products: a 500ml shampoo, a paw balm, and a conditioning mist.
            Each label required its own dieline and measurements, but all three needed to feel like one cohesive family.
            The layouts focus on clear hierarchy, gentle illustrations, and enough breathing room so the products still
            feel premium and calm. The final designs balance softness with clarity, while keeping information legible
            across the different label sizes.
          </p>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Brand in Context</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            To show how SEVEN works beyond the packaging, I applied the brand to posters, social media graphics,
            sticker concepts, web banners, and additional promotional layouts. These pieces helped prove that the
            identity can adapt to different formats while still feeling calm, modern, and nurturing.

          <h3 class="project-heading">2-Page Magazine Spread</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            A 2-page magazine spread was created to showcase SEVEN’s story in a more editorial format. The layout uses
            a clean grid, generous white space, and carefully balanced typography so the products and photography can
            breathe. This spread is designed to feel calm and premium while still being approachable for pet owners.

          </div>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Promotional Video / Demo Reel</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            The promotional video and demo reel highlight SEVEN’s calm and nature-inspired identity through gentle movement,
            soft transitions, and warm earthy tones. The motion design focuses on showcasing the products in a clean, 
            nurturing environment while emphasizing wellness, daily care routines, and the emotional bond between pets 
            and their owners. The demo reel brings the brand to life by combining product shots, typography, and visual 
            storytelling in a smooth, cohesive sequence.</p>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Problems Encountered</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            One of the main challenges was maintaining brand consistency across different packaging sizes. Each product
            label had unique dimensions, so keeping the alignment, spacing, and hierarchy balanced required careful
            planning. Fitting all of the required information on the smaller labels, especially the paw balm, was also
            difficult without sacrificing readability.
          </p>
          <p class="project-text">
            Another challenge was finding the right balance between natural and playful tones in the color palette.
            The brand needed to feel warm and friendly but still eco-conscious and trustworthy. I also had to make sure
            the posters, social media graphics, magazine spread, and video all shared the same visual language so SEVEN
            felt cohesive across every platform.
          </p>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Personal Reflection</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            I truly enjoyed creating SEVEN because it allowed me to combine two things I deeply care about: design and
            my background as a veterinarian. I have always dreamed of creating something meaningful for dogs, and this
            project finally gave me the opportunity to bring that dream to life. Being able to merge my creativity with
            my experience in animal care made this brand very personal, and it is a project I am genuinely proud of.
