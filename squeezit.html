          <h3 class="project-heading">Project</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            Squeezit is a character-driven rebrand of a fruit-flavoured juice drink, created to feel like
            a tiny playground in a bottle. The brand focuses on bold flavours, collectible characters, and
            an eco-conscious squishy cap that kids can keep and reuse.
          </p>

          <h3 class="project-heading">About</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            The Squeezit world is built around the “Flavour Friends” – a cast of chibi-style fruit characters
            that each represent a different flavour and personality. The brand combines bright colours, soft
            shapes, and playful motion to make every drink feel like a fun, character-led moment rather than
            just another juice.
          </p>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Hero Artwork</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            The main hero composition introduces the full Squeezit lineup together, highlighting the characters,
            flavoured splashes, and the squishy cap as a collectible toy.

          <h3 class="project-heading">Logo Development, Sketches, and Colour Palette</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            Before finalizing the Squeezit identity, I started with loose sketches and mockups to explore how the
            Flavour Friends, bottles, and splashes could all live together as one system. These early layouts helped
            define where the logo would sit, how the characters would interact with the packaging, and how much space
            was needed for important information on each panel.
        </p>
        
        <div class="project-image-box">
             <img src="images/Squeeze It-MockBoard.png" alt="Brand Mockup Sketch Images" class="project-image">
             <img src="images/Squeezit_Color.png" alt="Brand Color" class="project-image">
             <img src="images/Squeezit_logo.png" alt="Final Logo" class="project-image">
            </div>
            
        <p class="project-text">
            From there, I refined the logo into a rounded, bouncy wordmark inspired by the squishy caps and fruit
            characters. The final colour palette is built around sun-ripened oranges, berry reds, grape purples,
            bright yellows, and fresh greens, with plenty of white space to keep the brand feeling light and
            easy to read.
        </p>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Packaging and Label Design</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            Each flavour has its own label featuring a unique character, splash shape, and colour combination,
            while sharing a consistent layout structure. The front panel focuses on the logo, flavour name, and
            character, while the side and back panels include nutrition facts, icons, and a friendly brand story
            for parents.
          </p>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Digital Layouts</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            To extend the brand beyond packaging, I created simple mobile and tablet layouts for a homepage and
            character profiles. These screens highlight featured flavours, character stories, activities, and a
            section for sustainability and the reuse of squishy caps.
          </p>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Challenges and Solutions</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            One of the main challenges was balancing the high-energy character art and colour palette with a layout
            that still felt organized and readable. I resolved this by using strong margins, consistent type scales,
            and clear hierarchy so that the brand stayed playful without becoming overwhelming.
          </p>
          <p class="project-text">
            Another challenge was keeping all six flavours feeling unique but clearly part of one system. By locking
            in a strict structure for the label layout and only changing key elements like character art, main colour,
            and splash illustration, the lineup looks cohesive while still giving each flavour its own personality.
          </p>

          <h3 class="project-heading">Personal Reflection</h3>
          <p class="project-text">
            Squeezit gave me the chance to combine character design, branding, packaging, motion, and front-end
            development in one project. Building a small universe around the Flavour Friends and then translating
            that into both physical packaging and digital layouts was a process I really enjoyed, and it is a project
            I am proud to showcase in my portfolio.
          </p>
